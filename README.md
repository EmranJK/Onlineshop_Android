# Onlineshop_Android

In this assignment I create an Onlineshop Android app that an Onlineshop owner can use to add, update, delete, list, search and filter grocery products in his/her shop. The owner can add a name, price, brand, type, image and provider location (provider longitude, provider latitude, zoom) to his/her products. The product ID is randomly generated.
